## Data
### LODES OD dataset

The original data is LODES (LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics) dataset in [LEHD](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/) (Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics) project by United States Census Bureau. The LODES dataset is a census survey connecting homes (origins) and workplaces (destinations) at a Census Block level, including origin-destination pairs and locations.

We agggregate origin-destination patterns of 2018 into grid level.
